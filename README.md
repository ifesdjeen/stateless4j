# Introduction

Create state machines and lightweight state machine-based workflows directly in java code:

```java
Action callStartTimer = new Action() {
        @Override
        public void doIt() {
                StartCallTimer();
        }
};
Action callStopTimer = new Action() {
        @Override
        public void doIt() {
                StopCallTimer();
        }
};
StateMachine<State, Trigger> phoneCall = new StateMachine<State, Trigger>(State.OffHook);

phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook)
                  .Permit(Trigger.CallDialed, State.Ringing);

phoneCall.Configure(State.Ringing)
                  .Permit(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
                  .Permit(Trigger.CallConnected, State.Connected);

phoneCall.Configure(State.Connected)
                  .OnEntry(callStartTimer)
                  .OnExit(callStopTimer)
                  .Permit(Trigger.LeftMessage, State.OffHook)
                  .Permit(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
                  .Permit(Trigger.PlacedOnHold, State.OnHold);

// ...

phoneCall.Fire(Trigger.CallDialed);
Assert.assertEquals(State.Ringing, phoneCall.getState());

# Features

Most standard state machine constructs are supported:

  * Generic support for states and triggers of any java type (numbers, strings, enums, etc.)
  * Hierarchical states
  * Entry/exit events for states
  * Guard clauses to support conditional transitions
  * Introspection
  * Some useful extensions are also provided:

  * Parameterised triggers
  * Reentrant states
  * Hierarchical States

In the example below, the OnHold state is a substate of the Connected state. This means that an OnHold call is still connected.

```java
phoneCall.Configure(State.OnHold)
    .SubstateOf(State.Connected)
    .Permit(Trigger.TakenOffHold, State.Connected)
    .Permit(Trigger.HungUp, State.OffHook)
    .Permit(Trigger.PhoneHurledAgainstWall, State.PhoneDestroyed);
```

In addition to the `StateMachine.State` property, which will report the
precise current state, an `IsInState(State)` method is
provided. `IsInState(State)` will take substates into account, so that if
the example above was in the OnHold state, `IsInState(State.Connected)`
would also evaluate to true.

Entry/Exit Events In the example, the `StartCallTimer()` method will be
executed when a call is connected. The `StopCallTimer()` will be executed
when call completes (by either hanging up or hurling the phone against
the wall.)

The call can move between the Connected and OnHold states without the
`StartCallTimer()` and `StopCallTimer()` methods being called repeatedly
because the OnHold state is a substate of the Connected state.

Entry/Exit event handlers can be supplied with a parameter of type
Transition that describes the trigger, source and destination states.
